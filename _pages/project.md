**Research Question**

The current project wants to develop and integrate eScience technologies to advance multidisciplinary approaches to analyzing digital stories across media and time. The overarching research question is: How do the varieties of digital stories about societal transitions evolve over time and across different media?


**Abstract**

This project aims to develop eScience technologies to advance multidisciplinary approaches of digital storytelling. When societal transitions happen, people respond by telling stories that create continuity and change. In a digital age, storytelling has become even more abundant, rich in variety, and accelerating in pace. The current _COVID-19 pandemic_ allows to study storytelling while transitions are happening. 

In a multidisciplinary team, we analyze how the varieties of stories evolve over time and across different media. eScience challenges include (1) integrating existing _Natural Language Processing_ tools to extract and preprocess stories from existing and growing collections; (2) further developing _Digital Story Grammar_ methodology to study narrative components in their mutual relations; (3) building a _Story Navigator_ that uses visualization tools, while also allowing for human interpretation; and (4) integrating the tools into the _Orange_ platform to allow re-use by students and researchers. 

We cooperate with national infrastructures, develop online tutorials, and organize a hands-on workshop to facilitate dissemination and long-term use. Interdisciplinary narrative studies will thus be enriched with necessary tools to analyze storytelling in a digital age as it unfolds in real time across different media and platforms. This can also support sustainable policy making in times of transition.


**Background**

When rapid _societal transitions_ happen, like economic hardships, mass migration, outbreaks of violence, or pandemics, people respond by telling stories to attribute meaning to what is occurring to themselves, their relations, and the world they are living in.[^1] Besides making sense of the present, this also entails a reconstruction of their past lives as well as an imagination of their future lives.[^2] Rather than merely representing changing realities, people construe both continuity and change in their stories and thereby contribute to the course of societal transitions.[^3] Hence, these stories are key in understanding the nature and impact of societal transitions.

Stories have a _multilayered and multidimensional_ structure which makes an interdisciplinary approach necessary. A narrative approach, which takes stories as conceptual and analytical starting point for research, has gained momentum over the past three decades in both social sciences and humanities, involving disciplines as diverse as linguistics, history, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and future studies.[^4] It is generally acknowledged that stories have a basic plot structure including five narrative components: (1) _scenes_, in which (2) _agents_ (3) _act_ (4) with particular _agency_ (5) to reach a particular _purpose_.[^5] The relations between these components need to be taken into account to interpret the meaning of stories. Based on human interpretation, several varieties of stories of continuity and change have been distinguished in different disciplines.[^6] Without being exhaustive, stories may show how transitions result in a loss of meaning; are perceived as manipulations to control citizens; result in a longing for restoration; contribute to life lessons; or foster imagination about change and transformation.

In the fabric of everyday social life, a multitude of stories mutually depends on each other in a _changing contextual network_.[^7] A main challenge is that stories are told by different _actors_ (like individual citizens, media personalities, influencers, politicians, artists, researchers) through different _means_ (like oral communication, social media, audiovisual modalities) and with different _purposes_ (like witness, create community, persuade). Depending on who tells which stories through which means and for which purposes, some stories tend to become more dominant over time and thereby contribute more to the nature and impact of societal transitions.[^8]

In a digital age, storytelling has become even more abundant, rich in variety, and accelerating in pace.[^9] Interestingly, the digital footprints of stories also allow new strategies for collecting naturally occurring or research-induced storytelling. These vary from collections of public broadcasting and web archives to research collections. Yet, actors, means, and purposes of the stories differ between these collections. The turn to human interest in journalism has brought everyday stories to the heart of mainstream media.[^10] The worldwide web provides means for storytelling to more official societal institutions, but also to action groups and individual citizens that are not always heard in mainstream media.[^11] Research collections document the varieties of stories that people tell about their lives, sometimes also with an emancipatory focus of giving people a voice.[^12] Whereas these collections are usually not representative of the general population, they all provide a different perspective on the dynamics of digital storytelling in contemporary society.
