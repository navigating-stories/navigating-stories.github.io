On Tuesday 28 September 2021, the kickoff meeting was held for the project [Navigating Stories in Times of Transition](https://navigating-stories.github.io/notebooks/). Three people attended the meeting: principal investigator professor [Gerben Westerhof](https://people.utwente.nl/g.j.westerhof) of the University of Twente and program manager [Jisk Attema](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/team/dr-jisk-attema/) and research software engineer [Erik Tjong Kim Sang](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/team/dr-erik-tjong-kim-sang/), both from the Netherlands eScience Center. Also in the project is assistant professor [Anneke Sools](https://people.utwente.nl/a.m.sools) from the University of Twente and researcher [Stefan Bastholm Andrade](https://www.vive.dk/da/medarbejdere/stefan-bastholm-andrade-1634/). Still missing is the postdoc of the University of Twente. The university is recruiting now and we hope the postdoc will start in January.

The most important decision of the meeting was to start the project on 1 November 2021. Erik Tjong Kim Sang and Stefan Bastholm Andrade will perform the initial work.
	
The project will last for three years.
