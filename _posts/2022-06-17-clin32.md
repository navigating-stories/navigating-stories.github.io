On Friday 17 June 2022, Erik Tjong Kim Sang attended the conference [CLIN 2022](https://clin2022.uvt.nl/), the 32rd Meeting of Computational Linguistics in The Netherlands, held in Tilburg, The Netherlands. At the conference, he presented the current state of the project in a talk with the title: Navigating Stories ([abstract](https://clin2022.uvt.nl/navigating-stories/), [pdf slides](https://ifarm.nl/erikt/talks/slides-20220617-clin.pdf). Among others Erik showed the first results of Digital Story Grammar applied to Dutch stories in Orange. About 25 people attended the talk and there were three questions, two about evaluating the system and one about its installation.

Interestingly, the conference featured closely related work: Adriaan Lemmens and Vincent Vandeghinste from the KU Leuven presented their system for natural language processing targeted at humanities researchers ([abstract](https://clin2022.uvt.nl/practical-text-analysis-pipelines-for-humanists-with-deadlines/)). We spoke with the two researchers and agreed to exchange information about our projects so that we can learn from each other's work.

The conference offered many nice talks and posters. For example, in her keynote talk [Anna Rogers](https://annargrs.github.io/) argued that the field should abandon Natural Language Processing task leaderboards because the leading models on those boards do not really understand language. Also worth mentioning is the poster of Tim Van de Cruys, who built a system which automatically summarizes news articles as poems ([abstract](https://clin2022.uvt.nl/the-automatic-generation-of-poems-based-on-news-stories/)).

Later this year, CLIN will give the speakers at the conference the opportunity to submit a journal paper about their work. The next CLIN conference will be held in 2023 in Belgium or in The Netherlands.
